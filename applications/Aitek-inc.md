Summary


Helium is a pioneer in building a global IoT network, with huge potential and value. With our professional competence and production capacity, we aim to help expand the coverage range through building Helium gateways: connecting consumers, businesses, and developers. We will uphold the Helium values and strike to bring the best products and services to #ThePeople.
*We build both full and light gateways.



## Company Information (required)
* What is your company name? 
* How long have you been in business? 
* What kind of products have you created?
* How many have you sold?
* What brought you to Helium etc? 



Aitek Inc, founded in Dedham, Massachusetts, is a company with a compound business model, channeling solutions for modern demands of high technology. We have many resources, which can be used to design, optimize, and manufacture our products. Our founder who also founded Authright Inc, a company specialized in cyber security, is backing up our project by providing consulting and support. Well connected with our business partners/friends in the industry, we can provide and power up a complete supply chain. Not only with software security and application but also involved with chip design and optimization, which resulted in overall improvement of manufacturing and sales.


## Product Information (required)
* Is this is Light Hotspot or Full Hotspot? (please submit two separate applications for Full and Light hotspots)  Full Hotspot
* Is it for indoor or outdoor?  Indoor.
* Provide a brief description of what you're making.



## What is your approximate price point? (required)  Approx 500 USD

## Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts (required)
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. 
This would include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 



We are making a LoRa gateway device for the Helium network. We make both hotspot and lightspot gateway, and this is the specification of hotspot:

Product Specs:

 

For software applications, we have developed a customized Linux system for this project to ensure that the application can run stably, and as an added customized security strategy. The system integrates with a mature online upgrade program, which can ensure system upgrading while operating stably.



## What is your expected production and delivery timeline? (required)
 Upon approval, the first batch of delivery will arrive in 1-2 months.

## Previous shipments (required)
N/A
## Startups welcome! 
* Have you shipped anything in the past?   N/A
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? N/A
* Which countries do you plan to ship to?  North America, Europe, AU Region, Southeast Asia, etc.

## Customer Support (required)

* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products? 
* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? 

We will handle customer service requests via Email and Discord vendor channels, as well as the implementation of the Q&A section on our website. We will provide a one-year warranty on our device. To better serve the community, our team of customer service representatives with technical backgrounds is competent to answer questions and troubleshoot, before and after-sale. We also planned to implant real-time customer support after we ship approx 15,000 devices, to help break the stereotype of the lack of customer support in the Blockchain community. 



## Hardware Security Element (required) 

* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include a plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:
The swarm_key file stored into encrypted chip ECC508/ECC608.

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes
* Encrypted buses, potting,and other anti-tampering measures. Yes
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and share those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes

## Hardware Information (required)
* Please let us know:

* Which security (swarm) element are you using? ECC508/ECC608
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57)  SX1302 & SX1250
We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs 
* Where are you sourcing your components from? China
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? US915/EU868/AU915/AS923/CN470





Manufacturing Information(required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
* Have you built gateways before? 
* How many gateways did you make? 
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third-party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

Our trusted manufacturing partners in China have a complete mass production supply chain of Helium miners. We are capable of producing around 30,000 units per month now and will continue to increase our capacity.
Upon approval, our team will be able to mobilize funds and start the mass production ASAP. The finished devices will be then transported to the US, waiting to be dispatched. Additional team members will be hired to support operation work. Our investors and technical expertise will assist us along the way, ensuring smooth production and transportation for the growing demand of Helium miners.





## Proof of Identity


To be submitted privately to DeWi.


## Budget & Capital (required)
* How many of these are you hoping to make and sell? 
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on hand, and how much do you have access to? 
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures -- getting almost over the line and then running out of cash. 


We intend to produce 30,000 units per month to meet the current demand and more after the first few batches. We have secured all the capital needed to bring the first batch to market.


## Risks & Challenges (required)

In order to continue our production with our robust supply chain for Helium miners, we aim to secure the stock of critical components beforehand. Despite the remaining impact of a global pandemic such as shortage of chips, transportation delay, etc, We will get through the disturbances and scale production to meet the growing demand.
